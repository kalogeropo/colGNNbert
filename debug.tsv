what is the lipid composition of cf respiratory secretions	what is the lipid composition of cf respiratory secretions	autoantibodies in serum and sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis sera from patients with cystic fibrosis cf and control persons were examined for the occurrence of rheumatoid factors rf of the igg iga and igm classes by an indirect immunofluorescence method and by the latex fixation slide test the prevalence of rf igg was significantly higher p less than among the cf patients than among the control persons while no difference was found between the two groups with regard to rf of the iga or igm classes fifty five of the cf patients had chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in their lungs and two or more precipitins against these bacteria in their sera determined by crossed immunoelectrophoresis these cf patients did not differ from the cf patients without chronic p aeruginosa infection neither with regard to prevalence nor titer of rfs but there was a positive correlation between the number of p aeruginosa precipitins in the chronically infected cf patients and their titers of igg rf nineteen cf patients were examined also for rfs antinuclear antibodies ana and anti dna antibodies in their sputum sol phase and corresponding sera rfs were demonstrated in the sputum sol phase from of the patients by the latex fixation test whereas their sera were negative in this test possibly indicating a local production of rf positive reactions for ana and anti dna antibodies were found in and of the sputa respectively and in higher titers than in the corresponding sera also suggesting a local production titers of autoantibodies in sputum were low and no difference was found between patients with chronic p aeruginosa infection and patients without p aeruginosa infection the possible role of autoantibodies in the patogenesis of pulmonary tissue damage in cf patients is discussed
is cf mucus abnormal	is cf mucus abnormal	steatorrhea a simple and rapid method of diagnosis a simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of steatorrhea is described the method is based on the assessment of the difference of specific gravity and lipophilic property between a normal stool and that in steatorrhea using a benzene nabr system the stool samples are dried pulverized and then investigated steatorrhea is defined either as a fat or more in a hour sample stool samples of infants and children were examined among these were healthy subjects with upper respiratory tract infections and with pneumonia a further children had celiac disease of them were on a gluten free diet and one child had cystic fibrosis the procedure described renders single stool samples suitable for the assessment of steatorrhea as a screening test the method proved to be rapid and accurate in the diagnosis of steatorrhea
what is the effect of water or other therapeutic agents on the physical properties viscosity elasticity of sputum or bronchial secretions from cf patients	what is the effect of water or other therapeutic agents on the physical properties viscosity elasticity of sputum or bronchial secretions from cf patients	factors influencing the frequency of cystic fibrosis in south west africa drift chance effect in a small community and consanguinity have resulted in south west africa s high cystic fibrosis incidence isolated communities generations ago in europe e g bad gastein where this congress was held surrounded by its alpine peaks could have resulted in gene enrichment which together with the increased fertility of the heterozygote could still be responsible for most of the cf seen wherever europeans live today
are mucus glycoproteins degraded differently in cf patients as compared to those from normal subjects	are mucus glycoproteins degraded differently in cf patients as compared to those from normal subjects	glycosylation of vsv glycoprotein is similar in cystic fibrosis heterozygous carrier and normal human fibroblasts the single envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus was used as a specific probe of glycosyltransferase activities in fibroblasts from two cystic fibrosis patients an obligate heterozygous carrier and a normal individual gel filtration of pronase digested glycopeptides from both purified virions and infected cell associated vsv glycoprotein which had been labeled with h glucosamine did not reveal any significant differences in the glycosylation patterns between the different cell cultures all cell lines were apparently able to synthesize the mannose and glucosamine containing core structure and branch chains terminating in sialic acid which are characteristic of asparagine linked carbohydrate side chains in cellular glycoproteins analysis of tryptic glycopeptides by anion exchange chromotography indicated that the same major sites on the virus polypeptide were recognized and glycosylated in all vsv infected cell cultures these studies suggest that the basic biochemical defect s in cystic fibrosis is not an absence or deficiency in enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of complex carbohydrate side chains
what histochemical differences have been described between normal and cf respiratory epithelia	what histochemical differences have been described between normal and cf respiratory epithelia	immunologic aspects of cystic fibrosis pp because of the prominent role of infection in cystic fibrosis and because of the genetic nature of both cystic fibrosis and specific immune defects considerable effort has been expended in determining if there are hereditary immune defects in cystic fibrosis patients that render them susceptible to infection against a congenital immune defect is the fact that the infections nearly always are localized to the lung with the same two organisms rather than infections at multiple sites involving multiple organisms specific immune mechanisms in the b and t cell systems are examined nonspecific host defense mechanisms include the complement system phagocytosis pulmonary clearance the pulmonary barrier to the systemic spread of infection protease inhibitors and factor xiii dependent systems hypersensitivity states include allergy and atopy allergic aspergillosis immune complex disease and hypersensitivity to pancreatic extracts the presence or absence of specific antigen components and the association of hl a antigens are also discussed
what is the association between liver disease cirrhosis and vitamin a metabolism in cf	what is the association between liver disease cirrhosis and vitamin a metabolism in cf	nutrition and immunity in cystic fibrosis has too much attention been focused on antibiotic therapy in cystic fibrosis thereby overshadowing other measures which have led to the improved prognosis this may well be true and there is no doubt that regular intensive physiotherapy performed daily by the patients relatives plays the major part in improving airway obstruction more skilful nutritional management including adequate pancreatic replacement therapy and high energy high protein diets will also have had beneficial effects on the respiratory defects the infected cf patient may not require high doses of antibiotics he too might benefit more from simple nutritional alterations it is not new to suggest that nutritional factors are important influences on the resistance to infection of the cf patient what we can now do is measure the different aspects of the immune response in such patients and those with malnutrition so that the simplest and most direct therapy can be chosen
what is the role of vitamin e in the therapy of patients with cf	what is the role of vitamin e in the therapy of patients with cf	taste correlates of disease states cystic fibrosis the purpose here was to test for a generalized abnormal sensitivity of the external chemoreceptive systems using a standardized method that separates sensory activity from biasing factors known to affect measurement of sensitivity the frequency distributions of salt taste sensitivity for patients with cystic fibrosis are given normal siblings and control patients did not differ statistically and they were combined into a single control group for analyses the patients with cystic fibrosis did not differ as a group from the normal subjects in salt sensitivity there were however two children with cystic fibrosis with taste sensitivities well below those observed among the normal children no age or sex differences in sensitivity were observed the taste sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis did not correlate with the shwachman and kulczycki rating of the severity of their disease of the seven children who had determinations of sweat electrolytes at the time of taste testing three failed to excrete sufficient amounts for measurements patients with cystic fibrosis as a group were not found to have more sensitive taste acuity than normal this corroborates the findings of wotman and associates and strongly suggests that a general abnormality of the taste system is not routinely symptomatic of cystic fibrosis henkin and powell hypothesized that extremely acute taste is related to elevations in the concentration of electrolytes in sweat this seems unlikely since the patients given sweat tests in the present study all had the high levels of sodium and chloride characteristic of cystic fibrosis yet all had taste sensitivities in the normal range wotman and associates suggested that perhaps the severity of the disease accounts for the appearance of hypersensitivity in the chemoreceptive systems the clinical ratings of the severity of the disease did not correlate with taste sensitivity
what is the difference between meconium ileus and meconium plug syndrome	what is the difference between meconium ileus and meconium plug syndrome	influence of mist tent therapy on sputum viscosity and water content in cystic fibrosis the hypothesis that mist tent therapy decreases the viscosity of sputum by direct liquefaction of the sputum in the lower respiratory tract was tested in patients with cystic fibrosis cf the first night all patients slept without the mist tent and the first morning sputum was collected for analysis the following nights patients were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or ultrasonic nebulizer the early morning sputum was analysed for volume viscosity water content and dna content an index of purulence there was no relation between sputum viscosity and dna content water content or volume furthermore there was no consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated and the presence or absence of an hour stay in the tent with either method of water nebulization these results therefore suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum viscosity or volume in patients with cf above a sputum water content of further increases in water content do not influence viscosity
what abnormalities of amino acid transport have been described in the small bowel of cf patients	what abnormalities of amino acid transport have been described in the small bowel of cf patients	a placebo controlled trial of cephalexin therapy in the ambulatory management of patients with cystic fibrosis the effects of oral administration of cephalexin were evaluated in a double blind placebo controlled crossover study in patients with mild to moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis for two years four month periods with cephalexin were alternated with four month placebo periods thus patients served as their own control subjects fungal vulvovaginitis occurred in two patients during cephalexin therapy during the years of study the rate of colonization with mucoid strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa increased and disease severity deteriorated in patients initially colonized with p aeruginosa short term courses of sputum culture specific antibiotics improved the course of some patients with mild to moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis treatment with cephalexin decreased the frequency of respiratory illnesses respiratory illnesses requiring antibiotics and hospitalizations for respiratory illnesses in patients initially colonized with staphylococcus aureus and or haemophilus influenzae and also reduced colonization with these organisms improved weight gain in of patients was associated with periods of cephalexin therapy pulmonary function tests remained stable or improved in or patients disease severity improved in patients not colonized with p aeruginosa

what are the gastrointestinal complications of cf after the neonatal period exclude liver disease and meconium ileus	what are the gastrointestinal complications of cf after the neonatal period exclude liver disease and meconium ileus	abnormal breakdown of alpha macroglobulin trypsin complex in cystic fibrosis the complex of trypsin with purified alpha macroglobulin from normals and patients with cystic fibrosis was studied the formed complex failed to reveal any proteolytic activity toward a high molecular weight substrate whereas the esterolytic activity towards a low molecular weight substrate was retained this esterolytic activity was resistant to inhibition by a high molecular weight inhibitor during iincubation at degrees c the complex with normal alpha macroglobulin was slowly inhibited by the high molecular weight inhibitor and regained activity with the high molecular weight substrate this phenomenon was not obtained when the alpha macroglobulin from cystic fibrosis was examined these data suggest that the gradual conversion of normal alpha macroglobulin trypsin complex into an alpha macroglobulin fragment trypsin complex is deficient in patients with cystic fibrosis
what is the most effective regimen for the use of pancreatic enzyme supplements in the treatment of cf patients	what is the most effective regimen for the use of pancreatic enzyme supplements in the treatment of cf patients	pharmacokinetics of methicillin in patients with cystic fibrosis the disposition of methicillin in normal subjects and in subjects with cystic fibrosis cf was studied after administration of single intravenous doses of mg kg the area under the serum concentration vs time curve for cf patients was on the average only of that found for normal subjects the low concentrations in serum were caused by more rapid urinary excretion of the antibiotic with rates of renal clearance averaging ml min per m in the patients with cf and ml min per m in the normal subjects no differences were found in volumes of distribution and metabolic clearance rates of methicillin or in rates of creatinine clearance between the two groups of subjects these data support previous findings with dicloxacillin which show that patients with cf exhibit unusually rapid active tubular secretion of certain penicillins that may necessitate use of larger doses of these drugs in treatment of infections
